## Simple Memory Matching Game

A front-end web application implementing a memory matching game.

**Built With:**

* **HTML:** Structures the game board and elements (cards, controls).
* **CSS:** Styles the appearance of the cards, grid, and provides visual cues for flipped and matched states (including a subtle flip animation).
* **JavaScript:** Handles the core game logic:
    * Shuffling the card pairs.
    * Handling card click events.
    * Tracking flipped cards and checking for matches.
    * Updating the move counter.
    * Determining the win condition and displaying a win message.
    * Implementing the reset functionality.

This project showcases the use of JavaScript for dynamic behavior and state management in a web game.
